# Raytracer & photon mapping - ISIM Project

## Overview
This project is a raytracer enhanced with a photon mapping technique in
order to compute global illumination in order to produce more realisitic
images.

## Resources
Store the absolute path to the directory containing the meshes and materials
in an environment variable named `PHOTONIZER_RESOURCES`.

## Usage
```
./photonizer scene_file.json trace image.ppm
```
